## Global River Runner

The Global River Runner is a vizualization simulating the path a raindrop would take, assuming it runs off into a stream and from then on to a terminating location, likely an inland water body or the ocean. The front end visualization was developed by [Sam Learner](https://samlearner.com). The back end is developed by [Dave Blodgett](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/david-l-blodgett?qt-staff_profile_science_products=3#qt-staff_profile_science_products), [Kyle Onda](https://kyleonda.com) and [Ben Webb](https://github.com/webb-ben)



It is inspired by the [River Runner](https://river-runner.samlearner.com), which offers the same visualization for the contiguous United States. The original River Runner relies on the U.S. Geological Survey's [Network-Linked Data Index]https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/nldi-intro/) API, which allows upstream and downstream traces of the US National Hydrography as represented by [NHDPlus Version 2](https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/nhdplus-national-hydrography-dataset-plus).
